    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>This traditional French pastry is first cooked on the stove top
        before the warm dough gets transferred to a pastry bag and piped onto
        baking sheets to be finished in the oven.
    </p>
    <p>
        It is especially important to pay attention to your technique and follow the 
        instructions correctly when you add the eggs. If it's damp on the inside, the 
        puff may collapse or quickly become soggy.
    </p>
